# Understanding Bitcoin

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries.

## Key Features

-   **Decentralized**: No central authority controls Bitcoin
-   **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist
-   **Transparent**: All transactions are recorded on a public blockchain
-   **Secure**: Protected by advanced cryptography

## How It Works

Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Mining computers solve complex mathematical problems to process transactions and earn new bitcoins.

### Notable Milestones

1. 2009: First Bitcoin transaction
2. 2010: First real-world purchase (2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC)
3. 2021: Bitcoin reaches all-time high above $60,000
4. 2021: El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender

## Impact on Finance
